# Janseva-KYC
A simulated front-end demonstration of how decentralized, token-based KYC could work using concepts like wallet authentication, user consent, token generation, and verification.

⚠ Note: This is a prototype simulation — no real blockchain or personal data storage is used.

🧪 How It Works


Connect Wallet


Simulates wallet availability




Submit KYC


User enters full name, ID number, and uploads a mock identification file
